  </p>
  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>3 medium-size eggplants</li>
    <li>1 cup of flour</li>
    <li>6 eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>4 cups fine Italian bread crumbs, seasoned</li>
    <li>olive oil for saute'ing</li>
    <li>8 cups of Scalini's Marinara Sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of grated Romano cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 lbs of mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
    <li>2 cups of ricotta cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Scalini's Marinara Sauce:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons of chopped garlic</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
    <li>8 cups chopped tomatoes (fresh or canned)</li>
    <li>1 cup of onions, chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of fresh parsley, chopped</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of oregano</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper</li>
    <li>1/8 cup of fresh chopped sweet basil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of black pepper</li>
    <li>1 pinch of thyme</li>
    <li>1 pinch of rosemary</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare the marinara sauce by lightly saute'ing the onions in olive oil in
        a large pot for a few minutes. Add garlic and saute' another minute. Add 
        tomatoes and bring sauce to a boil, then turn heat to low. Add remaining 
        ingredients, stir, cover and let simmer for one hour, stirring 
        occasionally.</li>
    <li>Wash the eggplants and slice them into 1/4-inch-thick slices. You may 
        choose to peel the eggplant before slicing, however you may want to leave 
        the skin on since the skin contains a lot of vitamins.</li>
    <li>Place the eggplant slices on a layer of paper towels and sprinkle with a 
        little salt, then cover with another layer of paper towels and hold it down 
        with something heavy. This will drain the excess moisture. Let set for 
        about an hour.</li>
    <li>Working with one slice of eggplant at a time, dust with flour, then dip in 
        beaten eggs and coat well with bread crumbs. Saute' in preheated olive oil 
        on both sides until golden brown.</li>
    <li>In a baking dish, alternate layers of marinara sauce, eggplant slices, 
        ricotta, parmesan, and romano cheeses until you fill the baking dish about 
        an 1/8 inch from the top. Cover with shredded mozzarella cheese and bake for 
        25 minutes in 375 degree F oven. Let set for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
  </ol>
