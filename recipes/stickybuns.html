    <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1 (0.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Glaze:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chopped pecans</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Filling:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chopped pecans</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Directions</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Make the dough: Pour water into a liquid measure. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar and
        active dry yeast; stir until dissolved. Let stand until foamy, about 10
        minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, warm milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until it just starts
        to bubble around the edges; do not boil. Remove from the heat and stir in
        1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup unsalted butter, and salt until melted. Let cool until
        lukewarm.</li>
    <li>Lightly whisk eggs in a large bowl. Add yeast mixture, lukewarm milk mixture,
        and 1 1/2 cups flour; stir until well combined.</li>
    <li>Mix in remaining 2 1/2 cups flour (1/2 cup at a time), mixing well after each
        addition, until dough comes together.</li>
    <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, silky,
        and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp
        cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>While the dough is rising, make the glaze: Melt 3/4 cup of unsalted butter in
        a small saucepan over medium heat. Add 3/4 cup brown sugar and whisk until
        smooth.</li>
    <li>Grease a 9x13-inch pan. Pour glaze mixture into the pan; sprinkle pecans over
        top.</li>
    <li>Make the filling: Place 1/4 cup melted butter in a small bowl. Combine 3/4 cup
        of brown sugar, pecans, and cinnamon in a separate bowl.</li>
    <li>When the dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured
        surface. Roll into a 14x18-inch rectangle. Brush 1/2 of the melted butter over
        the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border unbuttered. Sprinkle brown sugar mixture
        over top.</li>
    <li>Start at the long edge and roll the dough tightly, pinching the seams to seal.
        Brush remaining butter over the dough. Cut dough into 15 equal rolls.</li>
    <li>Place rolls, cut-sides down, into the glaze in the prepared pan. Cover and let
        rise until double in size, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Uncover and bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30
        minutes.</li>
    <li>Let cool in pan for 3 minutes, then invert onto a serving platter so the glaze
        is on top. Scrape any remaining glaze from the pan onto the rolls.</li>
  </ol>
